Automatically publish unique, relevant content every week from Copify's team of professional writers.

== Description ==

If you don’t blog regularly, you’re not alone. Most companies struggle to find the time and inspiration to update their blog, which means they are missing out on a real opportunity.

Statistics from content marketing platform HubSpot reveal that blogs which are updated regularly get 55% more visitors and 97% more links than those which aren’t.

This is where Copify can help. By installing our plugin and signing up for one of our [monthly packages](http://copify.com/blog-packages), we’ll deliver a number of blog posts every week. These posts can be pushed directly to your WordPress dashboard for quick and easy publishing.

== Requirements ==

* WordPress >= 3.2.0
* PHP cURL extension
* PHP JSON library

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the `copify` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu.
3. Enter your API key which can be found on the settings page of your Copify account.

== Screenshots ==

1. Add a blog package to your Copify account. We'll create you new blog posts each week.
2. Install the plugin, and your content will begin to appear in WordPress where you can review.
3. Optionally, select "Auto-publish" and we'll publish your blogs automatically with an image!
