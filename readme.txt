Automatically publish unique, relevant content every week from Copify's team of professional writers.

== Description ==

If you don’t blog regularly, you’re not alone. Most companies struggle to find the time and inspiration to update their blog, which means they are missing out on a real opportunity.

Statistics from content marketing platform HubSpot reveal that blogs which are updated regularly get 55% more visitors and 97% more links than those which aren’t.

This is where Copify can help. By installing our plugin and signing up for one of our [monthly packages](http://copify.com/blog-packages), we’ll deliver a number of blog posts every week. These posts can be pushed directly to your WordPress dashboard for quick and easy publishing.

== Requirements ==

* PHP cURL extension
* PHP JSON extension

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the `copify` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu.
3. Enter your API key which can be found on the settings page of your Copify account.

== Screenshots ==

1. Add a blog package to your Copify account and we'll deliver a number of posts to you every month.
2. Install the plugin and your blog content will begin to appear in WordPress, where you can review it.
3. Select "Auto-publish" and we'll publish your blog posts automatically with an image!
