Automatically publish unique, relevant content every week from Copify's team of professional writers.

== Description ==

If you don’t blog regularly, you’re not alone. Most companies struggle to find the time and inspiration to update their blog, which means they are missing out on a real opportunity.

Statistics from content marketing platform HubSpot reveal that blogs which are updated regularly get <b>55% more visitors</b> and <b>97% more links</b> than those which aren’t.

This is where Copify can help. By installing our plugin and signing up for one of our [monthly packages](https://copify.com/blog-packages), we’ll deliver a number of blog posts every week. These posts can be pushed directly to your WordPress dashboard for quick and easy publishing.
